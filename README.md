# Roblox Downloader for MacOS (RDM)
These scripts download the latest version of Roblox (either arm64 or Intel versions of Roblox)
## How to tell if your MacOS is arm64 or not
If your Mac computer has a M1 or M2 chip, then it will be arm64. You can also go into System Settings and click About This Mac.
## Difference between arm64 and Intel
Those versions are specifically optimized for the computer chip.
If you run a Intel version of Roblox on a arm64 Mac, it is still functional, though it won't be optimized for that specific computer chip.
## How?
